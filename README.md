## Overview

Graphriend is a test for Geek Development in Medell√≠n, Colombia; a Mini Social Network for show friends like nodes or graphs. This project use Clementine.js: a lightweight boilerplate for fullstack JavaScript development which utilizes MongoDB, Express and Node.js.

# Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [NPM](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mirabalj/graphriend.git your-project
```

To install the dependencies, enter the following in your terminal:

```
$ cd your-project
$ npm install

```
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database
PORT=8080
```

## TODO

- Change EJS + JQuery by AngularJS, or React.
- Use a library like [Async](https://github.com/caolan/async) to improve code in call nested to models.
- Separate login functions in other controller? Can be.
- Any idea to add quality and performance to application.
